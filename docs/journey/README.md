# Journey to the cloud

This article aims to present how to adopt the cloud leveraging the existing materials develop by IBM Cloud Architecture and Solution engineering team.

## Why Cloud?

The most important value points:

* Rapid deployment, scalability, ease of use, and elasticity to adapt to demand
* Predictable cost, optimized for workload demand
* Enable DevOps, increase developers productivity  

Private cloud adds:

* Knowledge of where data resides
* Apply own enterprise own security and governance policies
* Simplify integration to on-premise business functions

[IBM Public Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/) value proposition:

* Easy migration
* Adopt cloud native development and operations
* AI Ready
* Hybrid integration
* Secure: continuous security scanning for apps and data
* Easily integrate and manage all your data across vendors and clouds — on or off premises

Cloud is the technology for innovation and transformation. AI, blockchain, multi-cloud, SaaS integration, single page app are drivers for cloud adoption. The new application landscape integrate existing data centers, private cloud within corporate firewall and SaaS, Public cloud provider, IoT, traditional B2B...
The new landscape will be multi-cluster & multi-cloud.

IBM Cloud public offers a set of added value services to manage data, app development, devops, networking access, servers, security, AI, blockchain and more.... The [IBM Cloud service catalog is continuously updated](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog)


## [IBM Private Cloud reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/private-cloud)

IBM Cloud Private brings cloud innovation within your datacenter. It is a Kubernetes platform with optimized scheduling, with most of the IBM Middleware products moving to it and it:

* supports better cluster management, security capabilities, image repositories, routing services, and microservices mesh
* authorizes infrastructure automation with scripts (Terraform, [IBM Multi Cloud Manager](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/smartpapers/multicloud-management/))
* provides monitoring for container-based applications for logging, dashboards, and automation.
* supports network and storage policy-based controls for application isolation and security, and automated application health checking and recovery from failures

For product introduction see [ICP Product page here.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/)

With the [ICP catalog](https://169.47.77.137:8443/catalog) you can install a lot of IBM middleware products and some open sources and your own helm charts in few seconds.

## Challenges to solve

We recognize that not every organization is ready to move everything they have to a public cloud environment, and there are lots of reasons for that. IBM offers the richest range of deployment options – from Private to Public and Dedicated. Still, enterprises will face new challenges in broadening the adoption of Cloud to critical applications. We can group those challenges into different categories and we will address in next sections the best practices and other product informations we have developed for you:

# A journey...

## Architecture and Development

#### [Microservice reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/microservices/0_0)
Microservices is an application architectural style in which an application is composed of many discrete, network-connected components

* [Microservices in the world of integration](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration/blob/master/docs/hybrid-itg-platform.md)
* Public cloud for dev and test
[Stock trader app to ICP and Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM3oFNAH2dA&index=4&list=PLzpeuWUENMK37ZlLBc_pIlXlOWeGnYRA_)
* [Blue compute on kubernetes: a microservice reference implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes)

![](bluecompute_ce.png)

#### Innovate quickly with cloud native development

Leverage the following tutorials and articles

* [Tutorial: Deploy a cloud-native application in Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/demo/try-private-cloud-install-an-app)
* [Microservices with Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/microservices/microservices-kubernetes)

* [Use Microclimate to run an End-to-End DevOps environment on IBM Cloud Private](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-bluecompute-microclimate)

#### Refactoring app to microservices

Business wants to improve the application to increase client adoption and satisfaction. Monolithic applications are more difficult to change and moving to microservice architecture will bring velocity to the development team.

* [Refactoring application code to microservices](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/code/refactor-to-microservices), this article addresses the why and how to refactor an existing Java application to microservice architecture. They also cover data model refactoring
* [The process to start from an existing JEE to split into microservices is documented in this repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee). 10-15% of existing WebSphere workloads can be moved as-is to cloud.
* [WebSphere on the Cloud: Application Modernization](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/08/websphere-on-the-cloud-application-modernization/)


#### Polyglot applications

Use one the available [boiler plates, starting](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/starter-kits) code from IBM Cloud like Nodejs, Java, Python, GoLang, Swift...
and deploy them on ICP or IBM Container services.
Below is a list of how to guides for Java and nodejs app but also decision and event streaming:

#### Lift and shift

A need to shift from IaaS (VM, network, storage, security) to container and CaaS (kubernetes) and PaaS (cloud foundry).

* Java based lift and shift
 A Traditional JEE app running on WebSphere Application server can be lift and shift to WAS on IBM Cloud. The [Inventory Data Access Layer](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal) is a JaxWS application exposing a SOAP APIs. The figure below shows the deployed app in the IBM console   
 ![](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal/blob/master/docs/twas/wasnd-deploy-8.png).  
 The application is accessing a DB2 via JDBC. [Deployment explanation on tWAS](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-inventory-dal/blob/master/docs/twas/readme.md)
 We are presenting how to move an integration solution to IBM Cloud in this article: [Lift and shift of an integration solution](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration/tree/master/docs/toSaaS).

The benefits to run MQ on cloud is that you keep your skill set but use cloud speed to:

  * Create queue manager in minute.
  * Get product upgrade and patch done by IBM.
  * Pay as you use.
  * Integrate with MQ manager on premise.  

* DB2 lift and shift

It provides Role Based Access Control: editor, reader, operator, administrator roles.

You can use container security context to specify user and group used to run the container(s) within a pod and how to access filesystem.
